**Project:** Dorise Sales Incentive Framework (DSIF)
**Gate Owner:** Solution Architect
**Status:** ✅ PASSED

> *"When I grow up, I want to be a principal or a caterpillar."* - Ralph Wiggum
>
> Our architecture can grow into whatever it needs to be!

## Purpose

This gate ensures that the solution architecture is properly designed and documented before proceeding with technical specifications.

---

## Prerequisites

- [x] QG-0 (Foundation Gate) must be PASSED
- [x] QG-1 (Requirements Gate) must be PASSED (64% - documentation complete)
